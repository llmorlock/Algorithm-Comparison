COT 4400: Algorithm Analysis (Fall 2022)

Program to find the ith order statistic using 3 algorithms: insertion sort, heap sort, and randomized select.
Program will run the test on 10,000 numbers, then 20,000, ..., 100,000 numbers and compare the time it takes for each, in order to see how closely the algorithms follow their projected big-oh time.
